Added a reusable confirmation modal component that can be used to confirm any user action. The modal displays a customizable message in the format "Are you sure you want to [action]?" with Cancel and Confirm buttons. Currently used for logout confirmation, but designed to be reusable for any action that needs user confirmation.
